11. Select the  **ERROR** column to sort the character errors to the beginning of the list.

    >[!note] Ignore top-level domain errors, which cannot be fixed by the IdFix tool.


12. In the  **An Dung Dao** row, verify the proposed solution in the **UPDATE** column, and then in the **ACTION** column, select **EDIT**.

26. Close all open windows.
27. Sign out from LON-CL1, and sign in as **Adatum\\Holly**.


    >[!note] Where there are format and duplicate errors for distinguished names, the **UPDATE** column either contains the same string as the **VALUE** column, or the **UPDATE** column entry is blank; in either case, this means that IdFix cannot suggest a remediation for the error. You can either fix these errors outside of IdFix or manually remediate them within IdFix. You can also export the results and use Windows PowerShell to remediate a large number of errors.



    >  **Result**: After completing this exercise, you should have troubleshot synchronization issues with user objects in Office 365.
